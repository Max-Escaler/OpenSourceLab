1. Why is it important to choose a license?
- It is important to choose a license for your software so that you can fulfill the freedoms of Open Source software. If there is no license associated with your software, it is assumed to be all rights reserved and nobody is allowed to use or even run your code. A license allows others to take your software, run it, distribute it, and modify it as they please.
2. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
- It is very important that you shouldn't work on a project without an explicit license because any project without a license is considered all rights reserved. This means that you cannot run, modify, or distribute this software at risk of legal action from the creator.
3. Why the Web beat Gopher, do you agree with him?
- I definitely agree with one of his more minor points which was the usability of the Web over Gopher. The organization fo Hyperlinks instead of a complicated directory could definitely have swayed it in the Web's favour. As we can see from even recent software, usually the simpler and easier to use product wins out.
4. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources)
- The MIT license is chosen because it seems to be one of the most 'free' licenses allowing anyone to modify, distribute, run, or sublicense the software. This is chosen when you want the most amount of people to use your software with the lowest amount of barriers.
5. We want to create an Open Source curriculum and we chose MIT license because it is the most open license
6. Apache is best for companies because you can say that other people cannot use your trade marks or sublicense. You would like to keep your trademarks safe because that doesn't have anything to do with your code. LGPL is best for a developer because the only thing you need to release is the portion of the code that was from a project with a LGPL license. This allows that developer to keep some of his algorithms and some things propietary. GPL is best for the common good because every derivative work needs to have a GPL license and be completely open and free.

8. I want to work on a project that allows multiple people to cast music to a central device freeing up the host of the party to have fun instead of worrying about the music being played. The users would mostly be party goers and hosts. I would probably choose an Apache license so that people can develop apps for the system but I could keep my brand and trademarks safe.
